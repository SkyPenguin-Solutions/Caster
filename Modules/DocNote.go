This framework is one of the more weirder workaround frameworks, this framework and tool works by sending out ARP packets over networks and discovering certain IoT devices on the network

if the Manufacturer is anything like Roku, Google, Amazon, Raspberry Pi Trading Ltd or ARRIS Group, Inc. it gets seperated into its own list so the user can view and enumerate based on hosts

this framework also gives the user the opportunity to enumerate all devices in those lists by those commands, before a device is verified if the OUI or Manufac comes across as Unknown it will

attempt to make a connection on a few base ports like 8443, 8008, 8060 etc and attempt to categorize the device in the deatil, if it is 8060 and makes a connection it will make it a roku device

if the port is 8008 it will be a google cast device, if 8443 it will be a google cast device and so on from there. Because this abuses API's it must first make a dial connection to the address

on that given port name | YOU ARE YOUR OWN PERSON AND MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS IT IS UP TO YOU TO ABUSE THIS FRAMEWORK OR USE IT FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES, THE SCARE SECURITY TEAM IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY
